# Tiled Documentation

Welcome to the documentation pages for [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org), a
flexible tile map editor! Here you will find the
[Tiled User Manual](#tiled-user-manual) and the
[TMX Map Format](reference/tmx-map-format.md) reference.

If you're not finding what you're looking for in these pages, please don't
hesitate to ask questions on the [Tiled Forum](http://forum.mapeditor.org).

*This documentation is currently work-in-progress. Initially the relevant pages
from the wiki have been ported over, providing a limited amount of
documentation for specific Tiled features. Over time, this should become the
place to refer to for any details about using Tiled.*
